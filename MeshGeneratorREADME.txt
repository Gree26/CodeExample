MeshGenerator.cs README

This code was used in my capstone project for my Gaming and Simulation Degree. This project was called Dungeon Designer. 
Dungeon Designer was a game where the player could build and play through their own dungeon made in the Unity engine. This dungeon was viewed from an Isometric view and the was made up of 3d objects. So this ment that for the first time I would have to Dynamically generate a 3D mesh that would update whenever the player would place a new block. It would also have to place specifically what block they wanted. Think of similar to Minecraft in appearance. So this code is the code that was associated with generating that mesh.
